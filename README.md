## JOSEPH MUNGOMA

### I am long term life student whose interest is in all matters technical. As a Data Analyst, I can prove how the concept of data analysis applies to ALL aspects of our day to day. With over 5 years of experience in managing data and also working on technical applications, naturally I have discovered how my career seamlessly especially managing data and processing information overlaps with my ins and out when outside my professional environment. To know me is to know that I never shy from challenges and exposure to different technological environments. I welcome you to join me as I tranform into a data analysis specialist.

My Data Analytics Goals:

1. Hone my data analysis techniques and skills to solve challenges faced in the business world. and apply them in relevant business concepts.
2. Create multiple projects that will display different ways of interpreting data to inform decisions, strategically.
3. Achieve fluency in the coding language of python, dive into data visualization fundamentals and understand the architecture of data structures for better insights using SQL.
4. Apply the skills I learn in this cohort to change the trajectory of my career and make a difference as a data analytics professional.
